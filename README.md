# Phaser 3 TopDown RPG
This is my first modernized JRPG style game, created with Phaser 3. This is still an EXTREME WIP. I will be implementing many different game style techniques within the game itself, as I learn them.  i.e. in-game minigames, cutscene animations, dialogue, Tiled, etc.

So far I have just created a walkable town with collisions and animations, spawned enemies, and a couple of characters. Still need to implement party system, merge the many maps I have created in Tiled, building entrances, and dialogue system. Once I have at least the full town setup, I will work on inventory system, items, player stats, battle scenes, etc. 

Like I said...WIP.
