# Phaser 3 TopDown RPG
This is my first modernized JRPG style game, created with Phaser 3. I will be implementing many different game style techniques within the game itself, as I learn them.  i.e. in-game minigames, cutscene animations, dialogue, Tiled, etc.

Items so far:
- walkable town with collisions and animations
- spawned enemies
- couple of characters

TODO:
- party system
- merge the many maps I have created in Tiled
- building entrances
- dialogue system
- inventory system
- items
- stat menu
- battle scene


Currently utilizing the Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template provided by photonstorm (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template)
