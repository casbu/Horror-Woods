# Phaser 3 TopDown RPG
This is my first modernized JRPG style game, created with Phaser 3. This is still an EXTREME WIP. I will be implementing many different game style techniques within the game itself, as I learn them.  i.e. in-game minigames, cutscene animations, dialogue, Tiled, etc.

Currently utilizing the Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template provided by photonstorm (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template)


## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

### Run

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

 `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
 `npm start` | Build project and open web server running project |
 `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |
